# Abstract
A pre-processing method prior to segmentation, called colour normalization, has traditionally been applied to image data as an attempt to reduce variability and thus improve algorithm performance. While colour normalization demonstrated benefit to traditional classification and segmentation methods, it was not until recently where colour normalization was demonstrated to negatively impacted segmentation performance on various convolutional neural network architectures (CNN). The proposed work aims to further investigate the role of colour in CNNs by quantifying and comparing the response of a CNN model to red, green, blue (RGB), and grayscale images at various layers using Jensen-Shannon Divergence.  In addition, at the same layers, we produce the reconstruction of an image given a predicted encoding in order to examine if colour features were important to predict such encoding. By analyzing the response of the CNN models to colour presence and subtle colour changes, and by studying the reconstructions at various layers, a better understanding of CNNs can be realized and nuclei segmentation pipelines can be better optimized.
